 Study Notes: Git & GitHub Essentials

1. The Big Picture: Git vs. GitHub

It’s easy to confuse the two, but they serve different roles:

* **Git (The Engine):** An open-source tool that lives on your computer. It tracks every single change you make to your files so you can go back in time if you break something.
* **GitHub (The Cloud):** A website where you upload your Git projects. It’s like "Google Drive for code," but designed for collaboration and sharing your portfolio.

| Feature | Git | GitHub |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **What is it?** | Version Control Software | Hosting Service for Git |
| **Location** | Local (Your PC) | Remote (The Cloud) |
| **Main Use** | Tracking file changes | Sharing code & collaborating |

 2. Key Terminology (The "Lingo")

* **Repository (Repo):** Basically your project folder. It contains all your files and the history of your changes.
* **README.md:** The "front page" of your project. It’s written in **Markdown** and explains what the project is about.
* **Commit:** Think of this as a "Save Point." When you commit, Git takes a snapshot of your files at that exact moment.

3. The Collaboration Workflow

The guide highlights a specific workflow to keep code safe:

1. **Branching:** Instead of editing the "Main" code (which everyone sees), you create a **Branch**. This is a safe playground where you can experiment without breaking the original project.
2. **Pushing & Pulling:**
* **Push:** Sending your local "commits" from your computer up to GitHub.
* **Pull:** Grabbing the latest updates from GitHub down to your computer (crucial when working in a team).


3. **Pull Request (PR):** This is how you tell your team, *"Hey, I finished my changes on my branch. Can you review them and merge them into the main project?"*

4. My Practical Checklist

* [ ] **Create a GitHub Account:** My digital identity for coding.
* [ ] **Initialize a Repo:** Always include a README so people know what I’m building.
* [ ] **Use GitHub Desktop:** A great way to manage Git visually if I’m not ready for the command line yet.
* [ ] **Branch First:** Never code directly on `main` if I’m working on a new feature!
